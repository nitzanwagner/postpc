Theoretical question:

Save the token locally:

Cons: 
 1. Never changing the credentials will result in the app becoming less secure.
 
Pros:
 1. Quicker than each time accessing the server.
 
Using this token only in this current app launch, and re-request a token from the server each time the app launches again:

Cons:
 1. The pro of the previous option is in fact the con of this approach. Re-requesting the 
 token on every launch may be time consuming.

Pros:
 1. As before, the con of the previous option becomes a pro. The app is more secure since
 a hacker needs to "guess" the token upon every app launch.
